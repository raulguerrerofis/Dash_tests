# Tests on Dash

I am publishing these tests in the files dash#.py to train myself. This little project will be about the creation of a dash utilitary to plot the band structure of siesta calculations using the SISL API. The first project is about to select the spin plots in a band structure calculation using Dash.

1. The first dash1.py file only plots a simple bad structure.
